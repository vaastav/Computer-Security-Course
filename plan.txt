Goals:
1. Use what they get
2. Understand what they get

Cover Caesar and Vigenere ciphers.
-> Use openSSL to encrypt something and decrypt something
-> Implement a Vignere Cipher

Assignments:

Ciphers:
1. Breaking the cipher Columnar Transposition Cipher. HINT: Give a word or tell them to use digraphs 
2. Doing some other kind of encryption.
3. Analyse the cipher for weaknesses.
4. Steganography - Have as a bonus question

Data Security:
Symmetric Encryption
1. ECB - Electronic Code Book. One block at a time and each block is done independently. Same thing maps to the same thing. So you lose integrity
2. CBC - Cipher Block Chaining.
Assymetric Encryption
1. Signature Replays. - Validation of tokens. 
Hash Functions
2. Break MD5 with collision attack.

Exploit-Exercises
1. Modify the iso.
