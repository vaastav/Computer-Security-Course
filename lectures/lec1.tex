\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Why Computer Security?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To be able to \textbf{protect} and \textbf{prevent} your system and code from malicious attacks.
        \item To be able to \textbf{assess} systems and networks for security vulenrabilities.
        \item To write \textbf{secure} code.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A note about Security}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this course, you will be exposed to a lot of information about security vulenrabilities with computer systems and networks.
        \item \red{You are not to use this or any other similar information to test the security of, break into, compromise, or otherwise attack, any system or network} without the express consent of the owner.
        \item You will abide by the CS department's plagiarism policy that can be found here \url{https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/collaboration-plagiarism} 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Grading Scheme}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No final or midterm!
        \item 80\% assignments (6)
        \item 15\% presentation (1)
        \item 5\% in-class participation
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{What is Computer Security?}

\begin{frame}{What is Computer Security?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Security relates to computing or communicating in the presence of adversaries.
        \item What is being prevented? What activities should be prevented or detected?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Activity: World Wide Greed Bank}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You work at World Wide Greed Bank and the bank has decided to install a safety deposit box service for its customers. You have been made in-charge to come up with policies implement this new service. What should your policies care about?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Security Policies}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Just like the bank, you have some information that you wish to protect and securely communicate with other people who need this information.
        \item Security policies are basically the rules you want to enforce on your data/system/network.
        \item \textbf{Confidentiality: } Information should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties
        \item \textbf{Integrity : } Information should not be modified in an unauthorized manner
        \item \textbf{Availability : } System or resource shall be available for use as intended.
        \item Security Mechanisms are ways one enforces the security policies.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Ciphers}

\begin{frame}{Ciphers}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Encryption : } Process of encoding a message so that only the authorized parties can read and understand it.
        \item \textbf{Decryption : } Process of decoding an encoded message in order to obtain the original message.
        \item \textbf{Cipher : } An algorithm for performing an encryption or decryption.
        \item The whole operation of the encryption process is dependent on the \textbf{key}. This is just a piece of information without which it must be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decode the message.
        \item \textbf{Plaintext : } Un-encrypted information.
        \item \textbf{Ciphertext : } Encrypted information.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types of Ciphers}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Based on the type of Input Data:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Stream Ciphers} : Encrypt continuous streams of data
                \item \textbf{Block Ciphers} : Encrypt block of data of fixed size 
            \end{itemize}
        \item Based on the type of key used:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Symmetric Key Algorithms} : Same key is used for both encryption and decryption
                    \item \textbf{Asymmetric Key Algorithms} : Differents keys are used for encryption and decryption
                \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
